## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric teal (#00D4C4) to evoke a futuristic and innovative feel.
- Background color: Deep navy (#0B1221) for a premium, high-contrast look.
- Accent color: White (#FFFFFF) to provide clean contrast and highlight important elements.
- Font recommendation: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif, for large titles and small snippets of text. If more text needs to be shown, it can be paired with 'Inter' for a full font-pairing solution. Both are geometric sans-serifs with a clean, futuristic aesthetic. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a futuristic and minimal layout with large typography, smooth fade animations, and lots of negative space to create a premium feel.
- Minimal use of icons in electric teal to keep with the modern and premium aesthetic.
- Implement smooth fade animations and soft hover animations for an engaging user experience.
